While Using Tokens, the developer needs to configure so as to send the Tokens
with each and every time the Browser makes a request on behalf of the user 

TO avoid this, we can use cookies to store this data on our browser so that 
the browser automatically sends this token/identifier every time that particular 
user makes a request to our server

Cookies are of 2 types- Stateful and Stateless. 
1. Stateful Cookies are those that a server sends back to a browser and browser
    with a session identifier that the browser uses to make requests to the server
    and in turn finds some data from a database.
2. Stateless Cookies are on the other hand less load on our server

Express-Session middleware is a Server Side Session
Cookie-Session middleware is a Client Side Session

Serializing means to Serialize the User Data that comes from Google Login or Login
and make it available to the browser as Cookies
 
Deserializing means to Deserialize the User Data and from the Browser Cookies and make it to some value
available to Express
